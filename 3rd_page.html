<h3>Are robots conscious?</h3>
<p>No. The reason why is because they don't have something that we have. They have a robotic brain and some have cameras to see, but they don't need oxygen, food, water, or the correct temperature. Also, you can make a robot detect pain and act like they got hurt, but they don't actually get hurt. They are just following the commands the coder set.In the future, there might be robots that are concious.<p>

<h3>What was the first myth about a robot?</h3>
<p>Hephaestus, the Greek god of invention and blacksmithing was working on a defense for King Minos and his island kingdom of Crete. The king couldn’t have guards and weapons because they were too weak, so Hephaestus made a plan for a new defender. The defense system he made was a giant thing made of bronze that took the shape of a man. The robot was powered by ichor the life fluid of the gods (not electricity). The god named the thing, Talos, the first robot. The robot would go around the island’s perimeter 3 times a day and when he saw any ships coming by, he would throw massive boulders at the ship. If any survivors made it on board, he would crush the victims on his heated chest. He was to fulfill his duties day after day without any variation. However, the robot had an inner life that the victims couldn't even imagine. One day, the robot came across a ship that had a crew that came across dangerous paths to get the legendary Golden Fleece. The crew was very tired and wanted a safe harbor to rest. Most of the crew were scared and cowered away. However, one person saw a bolt on the robot’s ankle. The person told Talos that if she removed the bolt, she could make the robot immortal. Talos, not knowing that he was already immortal and human enough to long for eternal life, agreed. While the person said random words, the person behind Talos removed the bolt and ichor flowed out of the robot, draining its power source (I'm not going tell you about the Golden Fleece story because this is about robots).<p>
