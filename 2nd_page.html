<h3>Are there different types of robots?</h3>
<p>Yes! There are MANY different types of robots. Some examples of robots are robots that make cars, semi-self driving robots, and in the future, there will be robots that can be doctors!</p>

<h3>What materials are robots made of?</h3>
<p>There are many materials robots can be made of. The main ones are wood, plastic, aluminium, and steel. Wood is cheap and can be used with regular tools but they have to be hardwood. Plastic can easily mold and can be stronger if given the right chemicals, but it is bad for the environment. Aluminium is a soft metal and easier to work with but steel is many times stronger. Both are the most expensive material however.</p>

<h3>What are the main components of a robot?</h3>
<p>The 5 main components of a robot are the body/frame, the control system, the manipulator, and the drivetrain. The body/frame is the shell of the robot. It surrounds all the other components to make it look pleasing and to protect it. The control system is like the one that does all the processing. The sensors see the robot's surroundings and then give it to the CPU. The CPU then looks at the surroundings and use logic. The manipulators are kind of like your arms. Robots normally need to interact with the things around them so they use manipulators. Unlike the previous two things, robots don't need manipulators. The drivetrains are like your legs. They allow you to move from place to place. Robots that represent humans use legs. However, most robots use wheels to move around.</p>

<h3>What do you need to learn to make a robot?</h3>
<p>You need to first learn a basic coding language like C++ or Python. Then, learn linear algebra and physics. I know it's school stuff, but it is an important thing to learn for robotics. You then need to strengthen your skill of coding and take coding lessons. Then buy a robotic kit and try to understand why each part works. You then need to take robotic classes. You might want to to then join robotic clubs and seek help from others. After, join or watch a robot competition to better understand them. To build advanced robots, you need to trigonometry and statistics, take ROS classes, and if you want to take robotics seriously, you can get a degree of robotics engineering. If you are unable to take robotics engineering, you can also take mechanical engineering can do. If you do decide to take the degrees, then you can become a robotic engineer and continue creating robots to expand your knowledge.<p>

<h3>Why are robots essential?</h3>
<p>Robots are essential because when robots take the place of a person’s job, there will be plenty of better and new jobs to offer. This causes the economy to go higher. This is called innovation. Even if new jobs aren’t made, wouldn’t you like to not work and still have a good life?</p>

<h3>How are robots programmed?</h3>
<p>There are many ways to program a robot but the top three most famous robot teaching methods are the teaching pendant, the simulation/offline programming, and the teaching by demonstration.</p>
<h4>The Teaching Pendant</h4>
<p>This is most used way to teach robots. The operator has to move the robot and save each position. The robot will memorize each saved position and try to replicate the operator’s movements..The more saved positions, the more accurate the robot will try to replicate the operator’s movements.</p>
<h4>The Simulation/Offline Programming</h4>
<p>This most used in robotics testing to make sure the algorithm is working correctly before using a real robot.</p>
<h4>The Teaching by Demonstration</h4>
<p>This my favourite method. A person does a task a bunch of times but with something small different each time like moving the items somewhere else. The robot would see what the person is doing and over time, the robot can do it itself.<p>

<h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the programming methods?</h3>
<h4>The Teaching Pendant</h4>
<h5>Advantages</h5>
<p>Most traditional industrial robots come with a teach pendant, which makes them familiar to technicians. The positions are also accurate and are great for simple movements.</p>
<h5>Disadvantages</h5>
<p>The robot must be put into "teach mode" and all operations using the robot halted until it has been programmed. It requires training to program and might be difficult to skilled craftspeople who are unfamiliar to programming.</p>
<h4>The Simulation/Offline Programming</h4>
<h5>Advantages</h5>
<p>The program is developed offline so the robot production is only stopped when the new program is being downloaded and tested and it’s easy to test the different ways to the same problem.</p>
<h5>Disadvantages</h5>
<p>The virtual models will probably never be the same as in real life, so the program may still need to be altered after the robot is made. It can sometimes end up wasting time sorting out simulator issues instead of solving production challenges.<p>
<h4>Teaching by Demonstration</h4>
<h5>Advantages</h5>
<p>You don’t need as many buttons to control the robot. You only need to move it to the desired position and the robot is very easy to code because you need to code it as only a human would perform it. It is also very good for detailed tasks that would normally need many lines of code.</p>
<h5>Disadvantages</h5>
<p>You need to program the physical robot so it does not reduce as much downtime as offline programming and moving the robot to a precise location is not as easy as the methods. Also, moving a robot for very precise tasks is very hard.</p>
